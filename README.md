# The Critical Role of the ASO AC in Global Internet Policy Development

## Motivation

As someone with over 15 years of experience in the ISP industry and Internet Address management, attending the ARIN Fellowship Program 52 in October 2023 was an enlightening experience. During the program, I had the opportunity to listen to a presentation by Kevin Blumberg on the Address Supporting Organization (ASO) of ICANN. His insights into the ASO's activities, particularly the ASO AC's role in global policy development, resonated deeply with me. I believe it is crucial to share this knowledge with a broader audience to highlight the importance of coordinated efforts in managing global Internet policies. This blog post aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the ASO AC's functions and the critical processes involved in global Internet resource management.

## Summary

Kevin Blumberg is an experienced member of the ASO AC (Address Supporting Organization Address Council), having served for seven years. Prior to his current position, he spent nearly seven years on the ARIN Advisory Council, where he held various roles, including Vice-Chair. Kevin is also the President of the Toronto Internet Exchange and is heavily involved in the Internet community.

The ASO AC plays a crucial role within ICANN and is responsible for three primary tasks:

- Global policy development,
- Appointing two directors to the ICANN Board, and
- Appointing one person to the ICANN Nomination Committee.

Kevin explains that global policy is specifically for managing the issuance of Internet resources (IPv4, IPv6 addresses, and autonomous system numbers) through the PTI (Public Technical Identifier) from IANA. Global policy is a unique mechanism for coordinating the distribution of resources.

Kevin stresses that the ASO AC ensures that policies are appropriately shepherded through each region's policy development process. While it doesn't work on the policy text itself, it ensures that all the required steps are followed in the development process. He also addresses the timeframe for global policy development, which can take one to three years, depending on the complexity and the need for agreement among various regions and communities.

Overall, Kevin provides a clear explanation of the ASO AC's role, the global policy development process, and the challenges and timeframes involved in policy development within the Internet community.

## Kevin Blumberg's Insights

Kevin Blumberg shared valuable insights during his presentation at the ARIN Fellowship Program 52. Here's a more detailed look into his explanation of the ASO AC's functions and significance:

Kevin Blumberg, a seasoned member of the ASO AC for seven years, brings a wealth of experience from his nearly seven years on the ARIN Advisory Council, including a tenure as Vice-Chair. Kevin is the President of the Toronto Internet Exchange and actively participates in the Internet community, offering a unique perspective on Internet governance.

## The Structure and Function of the ASO AC

The ASO AC is an integral part of ICANN, one of its supporting organizations, akin to the ccNSO and GNSO. The ASO AC's responsibilities are outlined in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between ICANN, NRO, and ASO. These responsibilities include:

- Handling global policy development,
- Appointing two directors to the ICANN Board, and
- Nominating one person for the ICANN Nomination Committee annually.

The ASO AC comprises the presidents of the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) and volunteer members. It is codified in ICANN's bylaws and plays a pivotal role in ensuring that global policies are developed and implemented efficiently.

## Understanding ASO, NRO, and Their Councils

The ASO is essentially equivalent to the NRO (Number Resource Organization). The NRO consists of two primary councils: the NRO NC (Number Council), also known as the ASO AC (Address Supporting Organization Address Council), and the NRO EC (Executive Council).

- **NRO NC / ASO AC**: The NRO Number Council (NRO NC) members are appointed or elected within each RIR region. They serve on the ASO AC. This council is responsible for the global policy development process, appointing two directors to the ICANN Board, and appointing one member to the ICANN Nomination Committee.
- **NRO EC**: The NRO Executive Council (NRO EC) is composed of the CEOs or executive heads of the five RIRs. This council collaborates with ICANN, making unanimous decisions and ensuring the completion of required tasks. For example, the NRO EC reviews and approves new procedures or requests changes as necessary.

## Global Policy Development

Global policy development is critical for the management and issuance of Internet resources such as IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses, and autonomous system numbers. This process is managed through the PTI from IANA and involves a unique mechanism for coordinating the distribution of resources.

Kevin elaborates on the global policy development process, emphasizing that the ASO AC does not work on the policy text itself but ensures that all required steps are followed. The process can take one to three years, depending on the complexity and need for agreement among various regions and communities. This timeframe includes obtaining consensus from diverse regional communities, staff, and legal reviews in each RIR, ensuring identical policy text, and multiple meetings.

## Challenges and Timeframes

Christian Tacit, another experienced member, contrasted Kevin's explanation by highlighting that internal ARIN policies typically take about 10 to 18 months to pass if non-controversial. Editorial changes could be quicker, but contentious matters might take 15 to 18 months. Global policy development, however, can take longer due to the necessity of aligning all regions and their respective policy development processes.

Kevin acknowledges the complexity and diversity of views involved in global policy development, which contribute to the extended timeframe. Each region has its nuances, making the process intricate but essential for the smooth distribution and management of Internet resources.

## Conclusion

Kevin's presentation at the ARIN Fellowship Program 52 provided a comprehensive overview of the ASO AC's role, the global policy development process, and the challenges involved. His insights underscore the importance of coordinated efforts in managing global Internet policies and ensuring the effective distribution of Internet resources.
